This directory contains test projects that exercise different aspects of ELF. Each project is described below:
1. **static-pie**: A zero-dependency, statically-linked executable with position-independent code.
2. **static-no-pie**: A zero-dependency, statically-linked executable with position-dependent code.
3. **static-no-pie-libc**: A statically-linked executable with position-dependent object code and libc.
